          <h1>About Open Source Tools and Cloud Platforms</h1>
          <p>
            Open source tools and cloud platforms are critical components of
            modern software development and IT infrastructure.Open source tools
            like EdgeX Foundry, Apache Hadoop, Kubernetes, and OpenStack play
            vital roles in modern computing. EdgeX Foundry facilitates
            interoperability for edge computing, Apache Hadoop enables
            distributed storage and processing of large data sets, Kubernetes
            orchestrates containerized applications, and OpenStack offers an
            open-source cloud computing platform. <br><br>Together, they form a powerful
            toolkit for building scalable, flexible, and efficient IT
            infrastructures across edge, data, container orchestration, and
            cloud computing domains.The combination of open source tools and
            cloud platforms empowers developers and organizations to build,
            deploy, and scale applications efficiently, fostering innovation and
            collaboration in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

            <h3>Edge-X Foundary</h3>
            <p>
              EdgeX Foundry is a vendor-neutral open-source platform hosted by
              the Linux Foundation, providing a common framework for industrial
              IoT edge computing. At the core there is a set of loosely coupled
              microservices organized in different layers.

            <h3>Apache Hadoop</h3>
            <p>
              Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities
              that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve
              problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It
              provides a software framework for distributed storage and
              processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.

            <h3>Kubernetes</h3>
            <p id="dark">
              Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for
              automating software deployment, scaling, and management.
              Originally designed by Google, the project is now maintained by
              the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

            <h3>Open-Stack</h3>
            <p id="dark">
              OpenStack is a free, open standard cloud computing platform. It is
              mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service in both public and
              private clouds where virtual servers and other resources are made
              available to users.
